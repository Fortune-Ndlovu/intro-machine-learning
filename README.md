# Intro to Machine Learning

Many machine learning techniques can solve interesting problems, from identifying email spam to classifying images. It is important to understand how libraries like scikit-learn work under the hood, to know their strengths and weaknesses, and to determine if they should be used for a given problem. 

This repo includes:

* What machine learning is and the various algorithms under its umbrella

* How regression and classification techniques work, from linear regression to neural networks 

* The API patterns of scikit-learn

* Use scikit-learn to make predictions on different types of problems, from email spam to image recognition 
Pair the proper application of supervised machine learning algorithms to a given problem and context appropriately
Explain how different machine learning algorithms work, including decision trees and neural networks
